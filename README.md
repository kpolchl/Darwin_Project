# Darwin World - Evolutionary Simulation

![Simulation Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Darwin+World+Simulation)

A JavaFX-based simulation of evolutionary processes in a dynamic ecosystem with plants and animals.

## Project Description
Darwin World simulates an ecosystem where:
- Herbivores move according to genetic instructions
- Plants grow in different spatial patterns
- Evolutionary processes emerge through natural selection
- Population statistics are tracked in real-time

The simulation is inspired by genetic algorithms and evolutionary biology concepts.

## Key Features
- Multiple world configurations (globe, poles, fires, tides, or predator territories)
- Different plant growth patterns
- Customizable animal behaviors
- Genetic inheritance with mutation options
- Real-time visualization with statistics
- Multiple concurrent simulations
- Individual animal tracking and genealogy

## Requirements
- Java 11+
- JavaFX 17+
- Gradle 7+

## Authors
-Karol Półchłopek
-Damian Chłus
